/*Name: Nishad Shah
 * Project Name: TwitterSample
 * Description: This is a basic program that allows users to create and read their tweets without going to their twitter account.
 * The default login is "user" for both username and password. After the user is logged in, he or she needs to click on the
 * "Authenticate" button to put in their information in order to access their twitter account such as consumer key, consumer secret.
 * authenticate token, and authenticate token secret. Once the user inputed all of the required information, they can go back to
 * the tweet app and are allowed to make tweets and look at their past statuses. 
 * 
 * All of the information such as the login and authentication information are stored in XML while the entire program was done in Java. The Twitter API used to for this program
 * is Twitter4j. The purpose of this program is to serve as a basic understanding of how to use a Twitter API by using GUI and 
 * Object-Oriented Programming. It's primarily based on using TCP/IP where it will send your tweet to your Twitter account and
 * retrieve any tweets you've made in the past.
 * 
 * This program shares a lot of similarities to the Thainang, which was a program that I was working on in my Software Engineer 
 * class because I was working on that program and the Twitter program at the same time during that semester. These similarities 
 * are the Controller, NavigationController, LoginController, Persistence, XMLPersister, DataModel, and User java classes 
 * files which were mostly used to access the login information for the user. I will continue to work on this program make 
 * further improvements and adding more features to it. 
 * 
 * (NOTE: Make sure you've changed your file paths of where you're xml file is located in AuthFrame.java and TweetApp.java.)
